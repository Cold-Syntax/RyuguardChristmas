            Two bois who work together in a sweat shop in the southern part of the Warzone torn Country
            known as Flordia. One was dragged from Brazil so he's fine. If anything, he's homesick cause bullets
            only fly for 5 minutes instead of 6. The other is a convicted felone. One half french, One half Aussie, and One half
            pathological liar. One of them once crawl through a runoff sewer drain during a strom just to hide from the police 
            whilst the were carrying a double sided dildo in their ass. Another has worked in NASA to secretly work with the 
            cartel and transport approximally 4.6 million dollars worth of beachballs with 12 dollars worth of crack stored in each
            ball after failing to read german.

        <p class="life-story">One of them was a professional cosplayer that accidentally killed their partner 
            and had to posed with their lifeless body since they were zombies and ran away unnoticed before burring them off 
            I-99. The other has once trained several little league players whom eventually became professionals through hard work 
            and drugs. One was secretly pretending to be a president of a company hiding under sheets as they were escorted by police 
            for money laundering while the real ceo escaped before fucking their wife, the other was ubering the Uni-bomber. As you 
            can see, we are quite qualify and are slightly racist, so we're pretty much CEO's of something. If you have any busniess oppurtunity 
            for us, please go to your local 7-11.</p>
